        <p>
            Ratings data has been obtained through two primary sources, Wikipedia, and Doctor Who TV.
            In order to be as consistent as possible, Wikipedia has been used as the primary source, and Doctor Who TV
            as a secondary source, only used when data is unavailable, or for episodes currently being aired.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wikipedia supplies a single rating for each episode on two listings pages, Classic Who and New Who. In addition to this,
            if you follow each episode link, where appropriate, additional breakdowns are included. Occasionally, the values on
            these two pages don't match, so in these cases, the value from the listing page is used, and the discrepancy noted.
            This note is available on the "All Episodes" chart only. All ratings are shown in millions, and to two decimal places only.
        </p>

            The following definitions are used:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overnight</strong>: Those who watched the episode as broadcast, or recorded and watched the same day
                    the episode aired. Shown as "Overnight viewers"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Consolidated</strong>: Those who watched as broadcast, via iPayer, or other catch-up services, over a
                    seven-day period from the day the episode aired.
                    Shown as "Viewers after seven days" or "Additional viewers after seven days" when shown as the difference
                    between the consolidated figure and the overnight figure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Extended</strong>: Those who watched via any viewing method, on any device, including tablets and
                    phones, over a seven-day period from the day the episode aired.
                    Shown as "Viewers after seven days on all devices" or "Additional viewers on all devices" when shown as the difference between the extended
                    figure and the consolidated figure.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            Because catch-up services, such as iPlayer, were not available for the Classic series, comparisons can be a matter
            of debate. Strictly speaking, only overnight ratings can be used on a like-for-like basis, i.e. who was interested
            enough to sit down and watch as it aired. Other figures may include repeat watching, which wouldn't have been an
            option for the Classic run. However, because catch-up services are now so prevalent, it's impossible to know whether
            someone would have watched it as broadcast, were these services not available.
            Generally, the consolidated figures are considered to be the final viewing figures for an episode, so this is probably
            the best for comparison purposes, i.e. Classic Who overnights vs New Who consolidated.
            In order to be fair, all three values are displayed, so you can make your own choice.

            In addition to multiple ratings, the UK population has changed since 1963. In theory, as the population increases,
            you would expect the ratings for newer episodes to increase proportionally as there are more people able to watch.
            To compensate for this, ratings are also available relative to the UK's current population.

            Only UK ratings are used.
